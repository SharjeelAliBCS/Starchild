## Story

Starchild is a game that takes place far, far in the future, in a time when humankind is governed by an order known as the *Imperium*. For many generations, the Imperium have worshipped the *Living Stars*, and thus bask in their power. However, slowly, one by one, the stars have faded, dying. Yet no one knows why. That is, until the player, the *Priest of Solnio* has been sent to prevent the death of the last Living Star, *Solnio*, and uncover the truth behind this heat death.
